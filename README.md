# Coursera Exploratory analysis
## Course Project 1

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>

## How it works
 Script plotting1.R  produce steps as below:
  1. Check if source data is in work directory.
  2. If not it downloads and unpacks archive from the internet.
  3. Script loads text file as data frame
  4. Keeps data for Feb 1 and 2 2007 only.
  5. changes Date and Time variables class to Date and POSIXlt
  6. Makes 4 diagrams as per project requirement.
  7. Cleans up envronment
## Running script.
1. Before run script make sure that you have at least 130 Mb of free space in your working directory.
2. Source file plotting1.R 
   `>source('plotting.R')`
3. You will get notification about execting steps. 
4. As script results you will see plot files in PNG format.

## Samples
 Resulting plots should be similar to diagrams below:
## Plot1 
  ![Active power frequency histogram] (plot1.png)
## Plot2
  ![Global Active Power over time] (plot2.png)
